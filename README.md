# SMU-Project-2-Crowd-Funding
Our mini project focused on building an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Python. The ETL process is commonly used in data integration and involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a target system or database. In this project the data we were given was from xlsv (excel spreadsheets), our priotary was to extract the data and format them into functional dataframes, once we created individual tables from our dataframes, we created an ERD with our tables.
