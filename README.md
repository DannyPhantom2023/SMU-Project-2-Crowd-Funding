Introduction
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a crucial process in data engineering that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a destination for analysis. Our mini project focuses on applying ETL principles to a crowdfunding dataset, with the aim of gaining insights into crowdfunding trends and patterns.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from our Canvas. It contains information about various crowdfunding campaigns, including details like campaign name, funding goal, amount raised, campaign duration, and more. This dataset provides a rich source of information to explore and analyze crowdfunding dynamics.

ETL Process
Our ETL process involves three main stages:

Extract: We retrieve the crowdfunding dataset from the source (which was an excel spreadsheet) and load it into our environment.
Transform: We clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating new features if necessary.
Load: We store the transformed data in a suitable storage or database, making it ready for analysis.

Analysis
With the transformed data at our disposal, we perform insightful analysis on the crowdfunding trends and patterns. Our analysis includes:

Visualization of funding distribution and success rates
Identification of correlation between funding goals and success
Time-based analysis of successful campaigns
Identification of popular campaign categories
